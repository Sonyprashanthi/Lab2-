        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <div class="grid">
            <div><img src="stock.png" alt="Project Image"><p>Stock Prediction</p>            
            <br>
            <p>Developed a machine learning model to predict stock prices based on historical data, news sentiment, and economic indicators. Applied techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks to optimize accuracy. Implemented the model in Python with libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow.</p></div>

            <div><img src="traffic.jpg" alt="Project Image"><p>Traffic Sign Recognition and Altering System</p>
                            <br>
            <p>
Built a deep learning-based system to classify traffic signs in real-time using images from a camera. Preprocessed and augmented the dataset, designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and achieved high accuracy on a benchmark dataset. Deployed the system on a Raspberry Pi for embedded applications.</p>

            <div><img src="customer.png" alt="Project Image"><p>Customer Segmentation</p>
                            <br>
            <p>Designed and implemented a customer segmentation system using unsupervised learning techniques. Preprocessed customer data, performed feature engineering, and applied clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN to identify distinct customer segments. Visualized the results using dimensionality reduction techniques and provided insights for targeted marketing strategies.</p>
